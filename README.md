This is some auto code that I have put together as an example to make it easier to understand.
Most of this code is very advanced but in the lesson on Tuesday Jan 21, I will explain.

Sorry that we missed one of the most important days of the week for robotics but we can
still do it.

With this code we can start developing our own autonomus while I work with some people to tune the new robot


These are last years PID values that are partly tuned (need more tuning):

//NavX Gyro PID
public static double NAV_GYRO_P = 0.1; // 0.031
public static double NAV_GYRO_I = 0.00281; // 0.00283
public static double NAV_GYRO_D = 0.0001; // 0
    
//Encoder PID
public static double ENCODER_P = 0.8;
public static double ENCODER_I = 0;
public static double ENCODER_D = 0;
